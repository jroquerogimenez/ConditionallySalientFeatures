In order to run the simulations for the article "Discovering Conditionally Salient Features with Statistical Guarantees", move the file simu.py out of the folder Code_KN and run the following line:


python simu.py --num_dim=200 --num_samples=50000 --num_non_null=50 --sampler_y='tree_depth_2_logistic' --cutoff=1.5


The different flag options are available in the file simu.py itself. Not all the options may currently work.
